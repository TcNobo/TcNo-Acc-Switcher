**A Super fast account switcher for Steam, Battle.net, Epic Games, Origin, Riot Games and Ubisoft (and more soon)**
**Saves NO passwords** or any user information*. Most switchers, including Steam work purely off changing a file and a few registry keys.
*Wastes no time closing, switching and restarting Steam and other platforms.*<br />
**NOTE:** Not created for cheating purposes. All it does is change accounts. Use it as you see fit, accepting responsibility.

# What's new

The new version is now out of beta! Please report any and all bugs, as well as steps to recreate them into the Issues section, or the `#bug-report` channel under `TCNO ACCOUNT SWITCHER` section on the [Community Discord](https://s.tcno.co/AccSwitcherDiscord). Download the Beta in the Discord (This is to prevent confusion here)

<p><img alt="Youtube" src="/other/img/youtube.svg" height=18"> <b>Guides:</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/cvbo_VY05bo">BattleNet</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qRYra_fQt0I">Origin</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/rLXGs1Yr3m8">Steam</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/XKBkIQaJzOA">UPlay</a></p>

**List of all platforms:**
**Epic Games**, **Origin**, **Riot Games** (Valorant, League...), **Steam**, **Ubisoft Connect** and **Battle.net** Thank's to [iR3turnZ](https://github.com/HoeblingerDaniel) :),

**Featuring**
-  **Better UI**, with animations. Fully user/community customisable **theme system**. 2 Themes built in (so far).
-   **Streamer mode** to hide SteamIDs and more while Stream software is running (ie OBS, XSplit...)
-   **Automatic updates** WAY smaller updates, due to using a new Patch system. No more redownloading the entire app. Only a few KB/MB at a time.
-  **Steam: Log in as Invisible, Offline and more!** Copy profile links, SteamID and create quick-switch desktop shortcuts!

\[For info on how any of these work, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/wiki)]


## Required runtimes:
**If you use the installer:** The required runtimes will automatically be downloaded and installed.
**If you are NOT using the installer:** Run `_FIRST_RUN.exe` on a computer to bring up the same window as in the installer, where runtimes are downloaded and installed.
**For manual runtime download and install**, see the [Wiki on this GitHub](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/wiki#1-installing-required-runtimes)

### Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/wiki) for more info and steps for your first launch.

	    <img alt="Website" src="https://i.imgur.com/izr2mKn.png" target="_blank" height=300">
	</a>
</p>
    
1. Download `TcNo.Account.Switcher.Installer...exe`
2. Run the installer, and the application should launch when done. If not:
Head into the folder where you installed the program and run `_FIRST_RUN.exe` to make sure required runtimes are installed, and then run `TcNo_Acc_Switcher.exe` to run the main program. The second is what shortcuts to the program should point to.

**For a portable installation (eg. on a USB) see [THIS](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/wiki#portable-eg-for-usb)** for steps on using the `.zip` or `.7z` below.

## LEGACY STEAM ONLY VERSION

[This](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/releases/tag/3.0.02) is then final release of the Steam only legacy version. You'll also need the .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime, below. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime: [Web Installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer), [Offline Installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-offline-installer), [Other languages](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)

**Screenshots:** [imgur library](https://imgur.com/prhdlks)

**Running the program:**
After installing using the installer, or downloading your .zip (portable version) from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/releases/tag/3.0.02) page, extract everything to a folder of your choice and run `TcNo Account Switcher.exe`

> If [HardenTools](https://github.com/securitywithoutborders/hardentools) was used, ensure that cmd.exe (Command Prompt) access is still allowed; if access is denied, TcNo Account Switcher will encounter a fatal unhandled exception (crash).

### How does the Steam switcher work

1.  It lists your accounts based on the names in "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\config\\loginusers.vdf"
2.  After picking one, it edits that file so that the one you chose is the latest, and makes sure Remember Password is set to true.
3.  It edits "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Valve\\Steam\\AutoLoginUser" to your selected username, and also sets the RememberPassword DWORD to True.

-   It ends any processes that start with "Steam", and then restarts Steam.exe once the switch is made. You don't need to do anything but use the arrow keys and press Enter.

**Options available**: Start Steam as Administrator, Hide VAC Status for each account and Show Steam ID, Start as Invisible, Offline and more. 

### Known issues

-   Issues caused by .NET Core (TcNo Account Switcher 2.0) are solved. No more issues clearing your `%temp%`
    (This is not an issue in the new Beta version, hence no fix)
