# Welcome

Thank you for contributing to the TcNo Account Switcher! If you have any questions or doubts, don't be afraid to send them my way. I appreciate all contributions, and I am looking forward to fostering an open, transparent, and collaborative environment.

Before contributing, I encourage you to also read or [LICENSE](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo_Acc_Switcher/blob/master/LICENSE), also found in this repository. If you have any inquiries or questions not answered by the content of this repository, feel free to [join the Discord](https://s.tcno.co/AccSwitcherDiscord) and ask in `#general-acc-switcher` under `TCNO ACCOUNT SWITCHER`.

## Creating issues

If you have a feature suggestion or want to report a bug, you are welcome to create an issue, or post it in `#bug-report` on the Discord.

Guidelines:

-   Avoid creating an issue if a similar one already exists. Look through existing open and closed issues first.
-   Keep your issue focused on one specific problem. If you have multiple suggestions or bug reports, please create separate issues for them.
-   Provide a descriptive title for your issue. Don't use generic titles like "A few suggestions" or "Not working".
-   Provide more context in the body of the issue. If relevant, attach screenshots or screen recordings. These are incredibly important as they help me understand what's going wrong and work with it faster.
-   Remain civil and respectful when participating in discussions.

## Creating pull requests

If you want to contribute code to the project, you can do so by creating a pull request.

Guidelines:

-   Make sure that there is an existing issue that describes the problem solved by your pull request. If there isn't one, please create it first.
-   Add a comment to the issue indicating that you want to submit a pull request for it. This can be a good opportunity to discuss possible solutions, finalize requirements, or ask questions.
-   Keep your pull request focused and as small as possible. If you want to contribute multiple unrelated changes, please create separate pull requests for them.
-   Follow the coding style and conventions already established by the project. When in doubt which style to use, ask in comments to your pull request.
-   If you want to start a discussion regarding a specific change you made, add a review comment to your own code. This can be used to highlight something important or to seek input from others.
-   Again, Discord is a good place to contact me if you'd like some more information on working with the project. I've already worked with a few people, and would be happy for that list of contributors to grow.
